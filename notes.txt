orik design notes.
decrease graph complexity by:
1. not incorporating domcomp_ nodes into the prov tree structure.
2. not incorporating dom_ nodes into the prov tree structire.
3. under the SYNC model, MRESERVED == NRESERVED+1. 
   ^need to make this is an option in iapyx dm rewrites.
4. //

other tricks:
1. smaller eots => smaller graphs
